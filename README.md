Hello Guys! This is one of the famous problem "Rat in a maze".
I have solved this using java swing. It uses recursions and Depth First Search 
concepts.A rat inside the maze can move in any of eight directions from its current 
position. Once you run the program in terminal , it will ask you to enter
the start and end position of rat. Then a frame will open that represents 
the grid through which the rat can go to reach its final position.
Then we can create walls by clicking the cells ,walls becomes black.
Then to start running thr rat,on top left corner of this frame,click 
menu,from that select "start".That's all .You can see how the 
problem is getting solved .It will be very useful to understand this problem in
depth!
HAPPY CODING :)
